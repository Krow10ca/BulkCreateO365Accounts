# BulkCreateO365Accounts
PowerShell script to bulk create O365 accounts and assign administrative privileges.

Warning: This was a quick and dirty script so I didn't have to do a bunch of manual changes. THere are issues that may be fixed in a later version but should be
a good starting point for anyone looking to do something similar.
